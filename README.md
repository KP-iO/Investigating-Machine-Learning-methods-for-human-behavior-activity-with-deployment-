# Investigating-Machine-Learning-methods-for-human-behavior-activity-with-deployment-

This project will look at machine learning methods such as K Nearest Neighbour, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. This project will also look to evaluate different parameters that impact the accuracy of the different models. In addition to this will also feature the deployment of the best model using an API created with FastAPI. This allows the model to be deployed in the future where further exploration on how this API can be used with smart appliances will be done. This project is carried out with the help of Python and many different libraries which is discussed during the implementation of this project.
